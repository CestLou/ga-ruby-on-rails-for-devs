Why Ruby?
=========

[http://ontwik.com/ruby/why-ruby-again-by-matz/](Why Ruby, Matz, creator of Ruby)

Ruby is an imperfect language created 15 years ago by Matz. Ruby is slow, lacks features, is too complex, rather inconsistent and loves memory. But it's enjoyable and fun - it's also a balance somewhere between BASIC and Lisp. With Lisp. If you stay with BASIC you are a coward, but if you go to Lisp you are brave and risk your life.

Most importantly, Ruby is about developer happiness. Therefore it has attracted some of the nicest people in the development community. People matter.
