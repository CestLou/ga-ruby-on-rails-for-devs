Live Rails MVC Application from Scratch
=======================================

We'll start with the skeleton built in [a previous lesson](7-rails-basics.md) and extend it with an MVC layer.

* Gemfile: gems, including Rails
* config.ru: rack-based startup script
* script/rails: rails-based startup script
* config/routes.rb: drawn routes
* config/environment.rb: application initialization
* config/boot.rb: application boot
* config/application.rb: application
* config/initializers/secret_token.rb: base cryptographic blob
* public/index.html: hello world
