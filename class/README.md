Class Curriculum
================

Introduction: Getting Started
-----------------------------

Students are able to demonstrate familiarity with shell, are able to setup a basic Ruby development environment and to execute simple Ruby code.

Lecture 1: Developer Workflow and Ruby Basics
---------------------------------------------

Students learn how to use Git and exercise the development workflow via Github that is used by the Ruby community. A successful student is able to exercise the Git/Github pull request workflow. An above-average student is able to use a topical branch in this process.

Students learn about the origins of Ruby and are fluent in basic Ruby language features. They are able to write simple object-oriented Ruby code and understand mixins and exception handling. 

A successful student is able to implement an extension to calculate a Euclidian distance between two hashes. 

An above-average student is able to implement it using Ruby `map` and `inject` constructs with less than 8 lines of code.

Lecture 2: Ruby, Rack and Rails MVC
-----------------------------------

Students learn about Rails and Rack by building a basic application on top of Rack, which paves a clear path to understanding what Rails is. The class generates a Rails application with the `rails` command, then makes a few steps back and assembles a Rails application from scratch. This lecture also serves as an introduction to test-driven development.

A successful student is able to extend the Rails application in the lecture with authentication using the `devise` gem by creating a user model in the database with a database migration. This application should run on Heroku.

An above-average student will also implement prompting the user to create an account if the application doesn't have any users.
