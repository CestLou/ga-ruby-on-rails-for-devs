Why Ruby?
=========

Ruby was created by [Yukihiro Matsumoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto).

[http://ontwik.com/ruby/why-ruby-again-by-matz/](Why Ruby, Matz, creator of Ruby)

*"Ruby is an imperfect language created 15 years ago by Matz. Ruby is slow, lacks features, is too complex, rather inconsistent and loves memory. But it's enjoyable and fun - it's also a balance somewhere between BASIC and Lisp. If you stay with BASIC you are a coward, but if you go to Lisp you are brave and risk your life."*

Most importantly, Ruby is about developer happiness. Therefore it has attracted some of the nicest people in the development community. In software development people matter most.
