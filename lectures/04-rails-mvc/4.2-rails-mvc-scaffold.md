Live Rails MVC Application and Scaffold
=======================================

Rails can generate a working rails application in a single command.

    $ rails new rails-basics

Model View Controller
---------------------

An HTTP request is sent to a *controller* via a route defined in `config/routes.rb`. A controller is a class that inherits 
from `ApplicationController`, which inherits from `ActionController::Base`. It will typically render a corresponding *view*,
which is a template in ERB, HAML or other format that gets converted to HTML. These templates often use a specific *layout*.
The view is often populated with data from a *model* that is usually retrieved from a database. 

An Integration Test
-------------------

Create a new test fixture.

    rails generate integration_test index

This creates a test in `test/integration/index_test.rb`. We can add some meat to it, checking that we can render the index.html page with a proper title.

``` ruby
require 'test_helper'

class IndexTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  fixtures :all

  test "fetches the index.html page" do
    get "/"
    assert_response :success
    assert_select "title", "Ruby on Rails: Welcome aboard"
  end

end
```

Asserts come from [ActionDispatch::Assertions](http://apidock.com/rails/ActionDispatch/Assertions).

Run tests with `rake test`.

Switch from SQL-Lite to PostgreSQL
----------------------------------

Heroku doesn't support SQLLite. Lets switch to PostgreSQL.

Change `sqlite` to `pg` in `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`.

Create a login role.

    $ psql template1  

    create role rails with createdb login password 'password';

Edit `config/database.yml`.

``` yaml
common: &common
  adapter: postgresql
  username: rails
  password: password
  host: localhost
  port: 5432

development:
  <<: *common
  database: rails_development

test:
  <<: *common
  database: rails_test

production:
  <<: *common
  database: rails_production
```

Create the databases.

    rake db:create:all

Assets
------

In Rails assets are precompiled.

    RAILS_ENV=production
    rake assets:precompile
    git add public/assets
    git commit -m "vendor compiled assets"

Deploy to Heroku
----------------

Heroku provides hosting for Rails applications and GIT-based workflow for deployment. Create an account on [heroku.com](http://www.heroku.com/).

    gem install heroku
    heroku keys:add

Create an application.

    $ heroku create dblock-rails-mvc --stack cedar
    Creating dblock-rails-mvc... done, stack is cedar
    http://dblock-rails-mvc.herokuapp.com | git@heroku.com:dblock-rails-mvc.git

Setup a *heroku* remote. This is a GIT-based destination to which we can *push* code. You can see your remotes with `git remote -v`.

    $ git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:dblock-rails-mvc.git

Push the application to Heroku.

    $ git push heroku master

Open a browser, `heroku open`.

Scaffold Domain Model
---------------------

    rails generate scaffold Thing name:string description:string

This creates a model, controller, views, a database migration script, updates the schema and writes basic tests.

Rakefile
--------

Tasks are written in Ruby and run with [Rake](https://github.com/jimweirich/rake). Rake needs a `Rakefile`, which imports the application's code. You can run `rake -T` to see available tasks.

    $ rake -T
    rake about # List versions of all Rails frameworks and the environment
    ...

Exercise
--------

Create a Rake task in `lib/tasks` that loads the `database.yaml` file and displays the database configuration for the current environment. When running this task, check whether the `database` value is set - you may need to set `YAML::ENGINE.yamler = 'syck'`.

Lets rebuild a [Rails MVC application from scratch](4.3-rails-mvc-dev.md).
