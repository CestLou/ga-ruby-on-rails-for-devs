Complete Active Record
======================

ActiveRecord is the default Rails Object Relational Mapper (ORM) and is the core of *Model Driven Design*. It encourages *fat* models and *skinny* controllers.

* Wraps a row of data
* Encapsulates database access
* Adds domain logic.

It's important to note that, unlike Hibernate or JPA, ActiveRecord is a leaky abstraction, it just makes SQL things easier.

Basics
------

A database table is a Ruby class.

    class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
      # class implementation
    end

Table names are plural and class names are singular. The table underneath the *Widget* class is *widgets*.

Attributes are inferred from schema. If *Widget* has a *name*, the class *Widget* automatically gets a *name* field.

All tables have an Integer ID. The *widgets* table has a serial *id* field.

Deployment and upgrade is taken care of with *migrations*.

Saving Objects
--------------

* `save` and `save!`
* `update_attributes` and `update_attributes!`

    widget = Widget.new
    widget.save # attempts to save the widget, returns true or false
    widget.errors # contains errors from save, if any
    widget.save! # raises an exception instead

Querying
-------

* `Widget.find(:first)`
* `Widget.find(:all)` or `Widget.all`
* `Widget.find(1)`

Finders by field value are implemented using `method_missing`, eg. `find_by_name`.

A leaky and lightweight SQL abstraction is provided.

    Widget.find(:all,
      conditions: [ "username = ? and password = ?", username, password ],
      limit: 10,
      offset :10,
      order: 'username',
      joins: 'accounts on user.account_id = accounts.id')

The following can also be invoked by chaining the methods:

    Widget.where("username = ? and password = ?", username, password).limit(10).offset(10).order('username').joins(:accounts)

It's also possible to use `:select`, `:group` and `:include` (eager loading).

Validators
----------

Validations are performed on callbacks via `validate`, `validate_on_create` or `validate_on_update` as well as through built-in `validates_presence_of`, `validates_uniqueness_of`, `validates_numericallity_of`, `validates_length_of`, etc.

    class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
      validates :name, :presence => true, :length => { :minimum => 3 }
    end

    widget = Widget.create
    widget.errors # => {:name => ["can't be blank", "is too short (minimum is 3 characters)"]}

Associations
------------

* `belongs_to`
* `has_many`
* `has_and_belongs_to_many` (HABTM)

Associations add methods to the class, eg. `widget.gadgets`.

    class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :gadgets
    end

    class Gadget < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :widget
    end

    widget = Widget.create!({ :name => "test" })
    widget.gadgets << Gadget.create!

Callbacks and Observers
-----------------------

Built-in callbacks, such as `before_validation`, allow participating in the object's lifecycle. Callbacks are instance methods.

    class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base

      after_save :saved
      def saved
        Rails.logger.log "created Widget with id=#{id} and name=#{name}"
      end

      before_create do |widget|
        widget.name = widget.name.capitalize
      end

    end

You can also create observers that derive from `ActiveRecord::Observer` that `observe Model` and implement callbacks, such as `after_create`.

Joins
-----

Joins are automatic with `:through`.

    class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :gadgets
      has_many :controls, :through => :gadgets
    end

Transactions
------------

    Model.transaction do
       # wraps commands within a transaction
    end

Polymorphic Associations
------------------------

Polymorphic relationships are created between objects that belong to multiple models.

    class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :controls, as: :displayable
    end

    class Gadget < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :controls, as: :displayable
    end

    class Control < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :displayable, polymorphic: true
    end

Single Table Inheritance
------------------------

Rails allows one to have multiple classes based off of a single table, using the type column to determine the class.

`Schema.rb`:

    create_table "badges" do |t|
      t.string   "type"  # Entry can be either 'Badge', 'BoyScoutBadge' or 'GirlScoutBadge'
      t.string   "name"
      t.datetime "created_at"
      t.datetime "updated_at"
    end

Based on the string in the type column, one of the following classes would get instantiated.

    class Badge; end;

    class BoyScoutBadge
      def tie_knots
        # tie knots
      end
    end

    class GirlScoutBadge
      def sell_cookies
        # sell mint chocolate girl scout cookies
      end
    end

This allows one to vary functionaly based on a type, but still have common persistence.

Exercise
--------

- Create a polymorphic association where both the model `instructor` and `scout` have `badges`.
- Create a single table inheritance heirarchy with the model `Animal` with the types `Fish` and `Bird`. Give them the methods `swim` and `fly` for the appropriate class.
